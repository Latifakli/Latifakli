### Hello 👋


I am Latifa, Web Developer Specialized in Symfony.

After several years working in the administration ✍️, 
I decided to move towards the profession of web developer, a universe that corresponds to my inspirations and my desires 😊.


To start learning the ropes, there's nothing like an intensive five-month training at O'Clock. Throughout this training,
I was able to acquire new notions and practices thanks to the pedagogical team 🤗 who provided me with the necessary tools to carry out my projects.

Actually, 
 - 🔭 I’m currently working on my portfolio
 - 🌱 I’m currently learning React and Wordpress.
